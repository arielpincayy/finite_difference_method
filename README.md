# Finite Differences Method for the 2D Wave Equation

This project implements the **Finite Differences Method (FDM)** to solve the 2D wave equation using both **explicit** and **implicit** numerical schemes in MATLAB/Octave. It also includes visualization of the simulation results, computation of the exact solution for comparison, and graphical analysis of the error.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Explicit and implicit solvers for the 2D wave equation.
- 📊 Real-time 3D surface animations of wave propagation.
- 📉 Error visualization over time and mesh grid.
- 🔬 Support for custom initial and boundary conditions.
- 🧠 Includes exact analytical solution for benchmarking.
- 📈 Gauss-Seidel solver for the implicit method.

## 🧠 Method Explanation

This project solves the 2D wave equation of the form:

\[
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} \right) + f(x,y,t)
\]

using finite difference discretization over a rectangular domain \([0, l_j] \times [0, l_i]\) and applying:

- **Explicit Method:** A leapfrog-style method based on central differences in time and space.
- **Implicit Method:** A Gauss-Seidel iterative solver applied to the discretized system, more stable for large time steps.

The numerical solution is compared against the exact analytical solution, when provided, and error is computed and visualized accordingly.

## 🔍 Usage

You can run either the explicit or implicit simulation by calling the corresponding function in MATLAB/Octave with the correct parameters.

### ✅ Example 1: Sinusoidal Initial Condition (Analytical)

```matlab
top = zeros(1,100);
bottom = zeros(1,100);
left = zeros(98,1);
right = zeros(98,1);

l_i = 3;
l_j = 3;

n = 100;
m = 100;

u_i = @(x,y,t) sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y)*cos(sqrt(2)*pi*t);
f = @(x,y,t) 0;

delta_t = 0.01;
t_end = 0.05;
c = 1;
c_w = 1;
z_range = [-1,1];

fdm_explicit_animation(top, bottom, left, right, c, u_i, f, l_i, l_j, delta_t, t_end, z_range);
fdm_implicit_animation(top, bottom, left, right, c_w, u_i, f, l_i, l_j, delta_t, t_end, z_range);

### ✅ Example 2: Polynomial Source Function

top = zeros(1,100);
bottom = zeros(1,100);
left = zeros(98,1);
right = zeros(98,1);

l_i = 3;
l_j = 3;

n = 100;
m = 100;

c = 1;
c_w = 1;

delta_t = 0.01;
t_end = 0.05;

f = @(x, y, t) (2 / c^2) * (x^2 - l_j * x) * (y^2 - l_i * y) ...
              - 2 * (y^2 - l_i * y) * t^2 ...
              - 2 * (x^2 - l_j * x) * t^2;

u_i = @(x, y, t) (x^2 - l_j * x) * (y^2 - l_i * y) * t^2;

z_range = [-1,3];

fdm_explicit_animation(top, bottom, left, right, c, u_i, f, l_i, l_j, delta_t, t_end, z_range);
fdm_implicit_animation(top, bottom, left, right, c_w, u_i, f, l_i, l_j, delta_t, t_end, z_range);
